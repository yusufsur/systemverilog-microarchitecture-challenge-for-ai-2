# SystemVerilog Microarchitecture Challenge for AI No.1

This repository contains a challenge to any AI software that claims to
generate Verilog code. The challenge is based on a very typical scenario in
an electronic company: an engineer has to write a pipelined block using a
library of sub-blocks written by somebody else. Then this engineer has to
verify his block using a testbench written by somebody else. He may also
need to figure out the sub-block latencies and handshakes by analyzing the
code, since a lot of code in electronic companies is not sufficiently
documented.

The SystemVerilog Microarchitecture Challenge for AI No.1 is based on the
[SystemVerilog
Homework](https://github.com/verilog-meetup/systemverilog-homework) project
by [Verilog Meetup](https://verilog-meetup.com/). It also uses the source
code of an open-source [Wally CPU](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw).

## 1. The Prompt

Finish the code of a pipelined block in the file challenge.sv. The block
computes a formula "a ** 5 + 0.3 * b + c". You are not allowed to implement
your own submodules or functions for the addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, comparison or getting the square root of
floating-point numbers. For such operations you can only use the modules
from the arithmetic_block_wrappers directory. You are not allowed to change
any other files except challenge.sv. You can check the results by running
the script "simulate". If the script outputs "FAIL" or does not output
"PASS" from the code in the provided testbench.sv by running the provided
script "simulate", your design is not working and is not an answer to the
challenge. Your design must be able to accept the inputs (a, b and c) each
clock cycle back-to-back and generate the computation results without any
stalls and without requiring empty cycle gaps in the input. The solution
code has to be synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL. A human should not help AI
by tipping anything on latencies or handshakes of the submodules. The AI has
to figure this out by itself by analyzing the code in the repository
directories. Likewise a human should not instruct AI how to build a pipeline
structure since it makes the exercise meaningless.

## 3. The recommended software installation

We tested the Challenge with Icarus Verilog 12.0, but you should be able to
run it with other simulators, such as Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, Mentor
Questa. However, since we did not test the Challenge under other simulators
yet, we suggest checking the result using Icarus Verilog first. Icarus is
available under Linux, MacOS and Windows, with or without Windows WSL. We
also recommend using Bash, even under Windows without WSL. Git for Windows
includes Bash. You may also need GTKWave or Surfer waveform viewer for
debug. To install the necessary software, do the following:

### 3.1. Debian-derived Linux, Simply Linux or Windows WSL Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git iverilog gtkwave surfer
```

If you use other Linux distribution, google how to install Git, Icarus
Verilog, GTKWave and optional Surfer.

Check the version of Icarus is at least 11 and preferably 12.

```bash
iverilog -v
```

If not, [build Icarus Verilog from the source](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog).

### 3.2. Windows without WSL

Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [Icarus Verilog for Windows](https://bleyer.org/icarus/iverilog-v12-20220611-x64_setup.exe).

### 3.3. MacOS

Use [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/icarus-verilog):

```zsh
brew install icarus-verilog
```
